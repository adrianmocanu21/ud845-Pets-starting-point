Pets App

This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs.

It was built with the purpose of learning how an Android App connects to a database and how it uses CRUD to manipulate data.
The application uses SQLiteOpenHelper (in order to create the database) and ContentProviders( for a better manipulation of the data that is introduced in the DB).
